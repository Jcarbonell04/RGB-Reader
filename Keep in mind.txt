indicate you arent using a pin in schematic
when orgainzing in a line actually use a bus
use net labels, or set global labels
grounds and power can be separate, not not have them going to one
no wires crossing labels
annotate everything, if a usb is plugged into something write that
if youre using i2c, need to see the bus scan (on oled, on debug console)

libs have chanegd to 


silkscreenof nucleo can show you the arduino pinouts , they aere in the silk screen, but not usedful for us)
