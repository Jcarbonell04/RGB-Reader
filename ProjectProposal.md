Research

Things I don't know, that I will need to do research on:
-----

Proof of Concept

For my proof-of-life build, I will be using a development board that fits into a breadboard.

Schedule

Week 1-2

Finalize Design
Procure proof-of-life components (MCU carrier, battery options)
Week 3-4

Assemble proof-of-life components
Master toolchain, begin software development
Week 5-6

Finalize design, complete initial software design
Week 7-9

Complete PCB design, software essentially complete
Complete dimensions for case know, begin 3D case design around PCB dimensions
Week 10

Send out PCB design for manufacture
When PCBs arrive

assemble, program, and test with current software.
complete added features, assemble into case
Check-off!
